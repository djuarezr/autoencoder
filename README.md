# Simple Autoencoder

## Description

This is my simple implementation of an autoencoder using Tensorflow. It is just a personal project, so it is not the best programmed autoencoder. It is just my autoencoder.

## Features

Currently, it is implemented:
- As number of layers as your computer supports.
- Dropout.
- L1 and L2 regularization.
- It can be a denoising autoencoder.
- Early stopping (with train loss, not validation loss).
- Scikit-learn compatible.
